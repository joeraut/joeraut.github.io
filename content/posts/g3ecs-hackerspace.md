I've involved myself in founding the George Education Electronics Engineering & Computer Society (a.k.a. G3ECS) for a while now, and have been having a fantastic time doing it.

Anyone living in the George/Garden Route area of ZA should really check this out. We have a huge variety of people attending from all ages, and are working on some cool things â€“ robots, etc.
