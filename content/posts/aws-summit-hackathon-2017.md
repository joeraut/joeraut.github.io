A couple friends and I participated in the Amazon AWS Cape Town Summit’s IoT Hackathon, which Intel kindly sponsored. Given an Arduino 101 (containing an Intel® Curie™) and a Grove starter kit, we had a couple of hours to have fun and see what we could hack together. As we were new to AWS’s IoT platform and the Python libraries we were given, it took us some time to get it up and running but we ended up with a working prototype.

We designed a prototype of a notification system for a cold room refrigeration system to monitor temperature and door opening/closing events, which are sent over to the AWS cloud and logged. We planned to add a stepper motor to simulate our door among other features, but we didn’t have enough time; We had to just use a push button to toggle the door opening and closing.

Here’s a brief video of our setup, and some pics:
