**I'm a software engineer at AWS and Computer Science student at Stellenbosch University. Oh, and I blog sometimes! üòÅ**

I find myself passionate about information security, IoT and machine learning, with a burning desire to learn new technologies across the stack.

On the hobby side, I enjoy putting together fun hardware and software projects, with a particular interest in interactions between hardware and the internet.

I work at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) as a Software Development Engineer, spending my time on the EC2 Core Platform and the fascinating challenges it brings. I've previously interned at AWS, [Entersekt](https://www.entersekt.com/) and [Impact](https://impact.com/). R√©sum√© available on request.

You can find some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/joeraut), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/joeraut/).
